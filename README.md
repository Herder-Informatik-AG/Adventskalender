# Advent Calendar

## Usage

To implement the advent calender you can follow one of the following steps:

### Embed as `iframe`

The probably easiest way to embed this is by using an `<iframe>` component with the following specification:

```html
<iframe src="https://herder-informatik-ag.github.io/Adventskalender" width="1000" height="800" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

This also allows for quick changes or fixes from our side without any changes on the website.
